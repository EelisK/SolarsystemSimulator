#	Lines that contain '#' are comments starting from that character
#	
#	Initialising a planet starts with the 'body' identifier
#	followed by the planets name, for example 'Earth'
#	
#	Followed by the body identifier you must set the location
#	of the planet and voluntarily the velocity also
#	
#	All planet data must be in vector form (starting with the 
#	x -component and followed by the y- and z -components [x, y, z])
#	Example vector:
#	[100, 100, 100]
#
#	Or if you prefer to enter only the x and y coordinates giving 
#	the z component a default value of 0:
#	[100, 100] => [100, 100, 0]
#
#	Entrering only '[]' will result by default in a zero ([0, 0, 0]) vector
#
#	Order of the planet data does not matter.
#	
#	Nothing in this file is case sensitive
#	
#	Locations should be considered as above,
#	the units being 10E6 kilometers.
#
#	Velocities are in [km/s] format.
